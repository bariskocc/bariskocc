### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a computer engineer and I am especially interested in the .Net Core Framework. 

I take care to write code by adopting software principles such as Clean Code, SOLID and I also try to incorporate these patterns into my projects in terms of Design Pattern. 

I am also interested in the following technologies; Azure, Micro Services, CQRS, RabbitMQ, Docker, Redis.
