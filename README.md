### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a computer programmer and I am especially interested in the .Net Core Framework. I am trying to improve myself in web development with C# language and I follow the latest technologies in this field.

I take care to write code by adopting software principles such as Clean Code, SOLID and I also try to incorporate these patterns into my projects in terms of Design Pattern. I am also interested in the following technologies; Azure, Micro Services, CQRS, RabbitMQ, Docker, Redis.

I am currently actively developing projects with Asp.Net and .NET Core Framework.
